  <h1>Chloroplasts</h1>
  <p>
    Chloroplasts are the main energy makers in a plant cell. They have a great advantage to mitochondrion, since they can make their own food. Similar to the mitochondia,
    the chloroplast has two membranes surrounding it, but also has a closed compartment with membranes called grana. grana are made up of thylakoids, and every chloroplast
    contains a hundred or more grana. Surround the thylakoid is a fluid called the stroma, with contains the enzymes that synthesize glucose to make food.

  <p>
    Chloroplasts do have their own DNA, but the same DNA can also be found in the nucleus. DNA containing organelles are called leucoplasts, which lack internal structure but
    could server as a storage site. A leucoplast that stores starch is known as an amyloplast, and the chloroplast, leucoplast, and amyloplast together are known as plastids.
