  <h1>Archaea</h1>
  <p>Archaea are one of the 3 domains of life, as well as <a href="bacteria.html">bacteria</a> and <a href="eukaryotic_cells.html">Eukarya</a>
  Archaea are singled cells prokaryotes that live in harsh enviroments. They are one of the earliest branches of life. DNA floats in the cytoplasm since
  they do not have a nucleus. Containes a cell wall and a cell membrane containing lipids. Some species have flagella, but they all have Pili which helps
  with attachment and dna structure, and they all have a gycocalyx, an outer layer that helps with protection. </p>
  <p>
    It is also important to note that archaea is one of the hardest domains to culture in a labratory, so we need more research to know more about them. 
    We know much more about their genes than their actual physiology. One of the distinguishing factors are their saturated hydrocarbonds, attached to glycol
    at both ends. This gives them better thermal stability. Archaea tend to more closely related to eukaryotes than prokaryotes in the way they make protein.
