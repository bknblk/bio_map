  <h1>Cell Walls</h1>
  <p>Cell walls are found in a vareity of species, but are meant to provide structural support to all cells. A key responsibility of the cell wall is to build the cell to withstand
    turgor pressure, the pressure inside the cell that keeps the shape. The material the cell wall is made with can tell you a lot about the cell itself. <a href="bacteria.html">bacterial</a> 
    cell walls are made with piptidoglycan, while <a href="archaea.html">archaeal</a> cell walls do not contain peptidoglycan and instead contain pseudopeptidoglycan, which is a similar structure
    with different chemical bonds.Plant cell walls are made with cellulose and fungal cell walls are made of chitin (the same one found in some insect exoskeletons).
