  <h1>Ribosomes</h1>
  <p>
    Ribosomes are macromolecule factories composed of RNA and protein that synthesize all other proteins. They use info from the genome to direct the synthesis of proteins.
    Ribosomes are only joined when actively making proteins, otherwise the two subonits are seperate. Messenger RNA carries information to the ribosome, transfer RNA carries 
    the amino acids. Only then can ribosome begin producing protein.

  <p>
    Ribosomes are either found freefloating in the cytoplasm, or attached to a an internal membrane. Ribosomes are one of the few things that are found in all living systems
    since every living thing drives on proteins.
