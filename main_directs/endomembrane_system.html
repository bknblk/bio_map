  <h1>Endomembrane System</h1>
  <p>
    The endomembrane system is composed of a couple main parts. The largest and most important is the rough endoplasmic recticulum, or the rough ER. it gets its name from the ribosomes
    attached to it creating a bumpy surface. All proteins made from the ribosomes on the endoplasmic recticulum are meant to be transported outside of the cell.
    Once these proteins are produced, they move into vesicles that transport them to the next part, the golgi apparatus. 
  </p>
  <p>
    The smooth endoplasmic recticulum, or smooth ER, can highly vary. The membranes might synthesize carbs and lipids, but steroids are also made there. The smooth ER also stores 
    an important chemical known as Ca^2+. This acts as a signally molecule, used to trigger muscle contraction. The smooth ER also acts as our bodies detoxifier, removing chemicals.
    This can be seen where humans need to be given a high dose of many drugs in order to combat the smooth ER in the liver cells. 
  </p>
  <p>
    The golgi apparatus is comprised of cisternae, individual stacks of membrane. The golgi apparatus is a smooth concave membranous structure that sends material packaged in vesicles through it,
    directing the flow of the vesicles. The golgi apparatus modified proteins that move through it, for example adding sugar chains. Lysomes are disgestive vesicles that come from the golgi apparatus,
    containing a high level of enzymes that could degrade the cell. Lysomes are responsible for recycling old cell parts, breaking them down and making room for new organelles. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Peroxisomes are microbodies within the ER that oxidize our fatty acids. Lipid droplets contained neutral lipids that sotre them for when the mitochondia or peroxisomes need them.
    These two components together form the base for our metabolism.
  </p>
  <p>
    Plants have an additional structure called a vacuole. These contain channels for water that help the cell maintain is osmotic balance. Vacuoles are specialized depending on the needs of the cell,
    and plant cells grow by expanding their central vacuole, not increasing their cytoplasmic volume.
