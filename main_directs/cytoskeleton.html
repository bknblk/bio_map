  <h1>Cytoskeleton</h1>
  <p> 
    The cytoskeleton is a network of protein fibers that shape the cell. The cytoskeleton is made out of 3 main fibers

  <h3 id="micro">Microfillaments</h3>
  <p>
    Microfillaments are long fibers, with are two protein chains intertwined together. Each subunit on the chain is made
    out of a protein called actin, which is where microfillaments get their second name, actin filaments. microfillaments
    have polar ends, which designate the growth of the filament itself.

  <h3 id="microtubules">Microtubules</h3>
  <p>
    Microtubules are the largest of the 3 elements, composed of a ring of 13 protein protofilaments. The filaments are arrayed
    side by side around a core, giving it it's tube shape. Microtubules are constantly polymerizing and depolymerizing, having
    an average half life of about 10 minutes. Microtubules facilitate cellular movement, organize the cytoplasm, and move
    materials around the cell.
  </p>

  <h3 id="inter">Intermediate Filaments</h3>
  <p>
    Intermediate Filaments are the most durable element of the cytoskeleton, which are tough protein twined together like a mesh.
    They are in between microtubules and microfillaments in terms of size, and are the most common in a cell. They can provide 
    structural stability within the cell, structural stability in the hair and fingernails, and even the filaments in nerve cells.

    The cytoskeleton does a lot for the cell, but one of those functions is to move material within the cell. It is solely responsible
    for shape and movement, but also helps with the <a href="endomembrane_system.html">rough ER</a>. Microfillaments contract
    muscles, and enzymes involved in cell metabolism bind to the microfillaments. In the cell, a vesicle moves along the
    microtubule with the help of a motor protein, and a connector molecule connecting the vesicle into the motor protein.
    The binding protein is the kinesin, and the motor protein is known as the dynein. 
  </p>
  <p>
    The arrangement of the microfillaments allow cells to physically crawl, one of the cellular phenomena, allowing cells
    like white blood cells to crawl and kill pathogens. The movement is throught the protein myosin, which contracts and pulls
    the cell towards itself. Eurkaryotes also have <a href="flagella.html">flagella</a>, it consists of nine
    microtubule pairs, surround two central micortubules. The pairs of microtubules move past each other, waving up and down.
    Many eurkaryotes cannot be found with flagella, and are instead found with cilia. They are more numerous than flagella
    and have the same internal structure. Cilia moves water and other waves over the cell, and can even be attributed to hearing.
