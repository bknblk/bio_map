  <h1>Mitochondria</h1>
  <p>
    Mitochondria is the main cellular component involved in energy generation. They are found in all kinds of <a href="eukaryotic_cells.html">eukaryotic cells</a>, and are bound by a smooth outer membrane,
    and an inner folded membrane. The inner folded membrane is called the crista. The cristae partition the mitochondrion into two parts, the matrix and the intermembrane space. 
    Mitochondia contain their own dna with its own genetic information. Unlike other parts, the mitochondrion divides itself when the cell divides, as opposed to the cell making a new one.
