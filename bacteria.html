  <h1>Bacteria</h1>
  <p>Bacteira are prokaryotes, with one of the most popular recently being E. Coli. Because they are prokaryotes, there are no membrane-bound nucleus, and dna is located in the nucleoid region of the cell. Like all prokaryotes, they are smaller
    than the average eukaryote. Bacteria contains a cell wall, membrane, and the normal internals like ribosomes and a cytoplasm. They also have flagella for movement, pili for attachment, and a protective layer called a capsule.
    Some photosynthesize, some break down other organic matter, and some oxidize ammonia. It is important to note there is a exception to this rule, where Mollicutes do not have a cell wall. Drugs used to combat bacteria often target
    the cell wall in order to make it collapse. Some bacteria have a jelly-like exterior which makes them stick to teeth, skin, and food.
