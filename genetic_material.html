  <h1>Genetic Material</h1>
  <p>
    In eukaryotic cells, the genetic material is stores in the nucleus. This enables the production of proteins by the <a href="ribosomes.html">ribosomes</a>. The surface of the  
    nucleus is bounded by two phospholipid bilayer membranes, making up the <a href="nuclear_envelope.html">nuclear envolope</a>. Chromatin is a complex structure that is found in
    eukaryotes. Chromatin is organizaed proteins and DNA strands that can be seen at a higher level during cell division.

  <h2>Cell to cell communication</h2>
  <p>
    One of the key sets of genes identifies cells to be of a specific type. Cells interact with eachother throught this gene.
    Glycolipids take up the majority of the markers, being responsible for your blood type. Adhesive junctions attach to the 
    cytoskeletons of other cells, which help make the intercellular structure. Cadherin can make flexible connections between
    cells, and can be classified between type I and type II. Desmosomes are made of cadherin and are a junction that are unique 
    to vertabrates. They join cells to support tissues against mechanical stress.

  <p>
    Septate junctions are another kind of junction that is meant to seal off a sheet of cells. Tight junctions are only found vertebrates, 
    and acts as a wall inside the tissue, isolating molecules. There are also communicating junctions like gap junctions, which are found in both
    vertebrates and invertebrates. These junctions open passageways that are large enough to permit small substances, like sugars and amino acids, 
    but they are small enough to not let proteins through.
